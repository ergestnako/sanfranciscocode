			    How would you improve the laws of San Francisco?  This is your chance to redesign the rules of the city, and earn a shot at a $1,000 scholarship.  Here\'s how it works:
			</p>
			<ol class="comment-instructions">
				<li>
					<i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>
				    Imagine A Better San Francisco:
				    Think about what you like best - and like least - about living in San Francisco.  Odds are, there\'s a law to match.  How would you fix what you don\'t like, or build on what you do?  Sky\'s the limit.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i class="fa fa-search"></i>
				    Find the Laws You Care About:
				    Now that you have a vision for improving city life, visit
				    <a class="c5" href="http://sanfranciscocode.org/">SanFranciscoCode.org</a>.  Browse and search through the laws to find what you care about most.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i class="fa fa-comments-o"></i>
				    Read, React, ReimagineSF:
				    Read the laws.  Decide how you\'d improve them.  Post your changes to each law right at the bottom of the page using Disqus.  Your ideas will go straight to the Board of Supervisors for action.  The top suggestions will be collected right here.
				</li>
				<li>
					<i class="fa fa-share-square-o"></i>
				    Tell Your Friends to Upvote:
				     Share a link to your ideas with your friends, family, and the world.  Ask them to upvote your idea, or leave a comment in support.  That makes your idea float to the top, which is where you want to be to win a $1,000 scholarship.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
			    San Francisco Supervisor Mark Farrell will select the 5 best ideas, turn each into actual legislation, then put them to the Board of Supervisors for a vote.  Oh, and those 5 student-legislators will each earn $1,000 for school.  Make an impact.  Win a scholarship.  ReimagineSF.

				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization#501.28c.29.283.29">here by Wikipedians</a>.  One policy is a prohibition on advocating for or against
				candidates for public office.  We
				will make a good faith effort to ensure content on OpenGov websites is
				compliant.  </p>

				<p>Please email questions,
				comments or concerns to The OpenGov Foundation at: <a
