In addition, for recipients participating in this program up to $2,000 of recipient savings derived from the recipient's gross wage earnings shall be disregarded during the recipient's participation in this program and for up to three months thereafter. Also, if as a result of retrospective budgeting a recipient's total currently available financial resources in a month including his or her adjusted General Assistance grant, wages, and savings are less than the maximum General Assistance grant amount, the recipient shall be eligible for a grant supplement in the form of a rental expense voucher for unpaid rent in that month and up to $50 in cash so that the recipient's currently available financial resources may total up to the maximum General Assistance grant amount.

All other recipient income and assets shall continue to be offset on a dollar-for-dollar basis when calculating the grant amount to which a recipient is otherwise eligible. For recipients participating in this program, General Assistance eligibility shall be determined on a monthly basis and a recipient's grant amount shall be adjusted for gross wage earnings on the basis of retrospective budgeting in the month following the recipient's receipt of wage income.

A wage subsidy payment issued to an employer in two installments shall only be issued by the Department of Human Services upon receipt of documentation of gross wage earnings paid to the participant by the employer for 13 consecutive weeks of employment and the second payment shall only be issued upon receipt of documentation of gross wage earnings paid to the same participant by the employer for an additional 13 consecutive weeks of employment. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Amount of Subsidy.

A wage subsidy shall not be paid to an employer for more than the first 26 weeks of employment. Participant \"gross wage earnings\" are defined for purposes of this Section as income received by the participant as payment for the participant's labor. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Authority.

The City and the shelter operators contemplated that the shelters would operate at or near capacity through most of the year. This legislation may reduce the number of beds available in some shelters. In addition this legislation will impose obligations on shelter operators that exceed their obligations under their existing agreements with the City and therefore increase their operating costs. City officials and shelter operators based their budgetary assumptions and contracting decisions on factors that existed before this legislation existed. Therefore, the Board of Supervisors authorizes each City department overseeing contracts affected by this legislation to negotiate amendments to existing contracts to reflect these changes so long as current contract amounts are not reduced; and 32. maximize the space for sleeping in the shelter to the fullest extent possible. \n(Added by Ord. 50-08, File No. 071518, App. 3\/28\/2008; Ord. 131-10, File no. 100437, App. 6\/24\/2010)\n\nSEC. 20.405.\u00a0 COMPLAINT PROCESS AND INVESTIGATION.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Each shelter shall provide client complaint forms in common areas of the shelter and shall make a complaint form available to a shelter client upon request.
