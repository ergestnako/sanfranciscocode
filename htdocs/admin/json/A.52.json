Deletions are in strikethrough text. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Be it ordained by the People of the City and County of San Francisco: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Section 1. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The San Francisco Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code is hereby amended by amending Article 1, Chapter 1 to read as follows: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0CHAPTER I: CAMPAIGN FINANCE \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SEC. 1.100. PURPOSE AND INTENT. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Huge sums of moneys often are necessary to finance American election campaigns. Inherent to the high cost of election campaigning is the problem of improper influence, real or potential, exercised by campaign contributors over elected officials. In addition, this fundraising distracts public officials seeking reelection from focusing upon important public matters, encourages contributions which may have a corrupting influence, and gives incumbents an unfair fundraising advantage over potential challengers. These developments undermine the integrity of the governmental process, the competitiveness of campaigns and public confidence in local officials. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It is the purpose and intent of the People Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco in enacting this Chapter to (1) place realistic and enforceable limits on the amount individuals may contribute to political campaigns in municipal elections and to provide full and fair enforcement of all the provisions in this Chapter; (2) ensure that all individuals and interest groups in our city have a fair opportunity to participate in elective and governmental processes; (3) create an incentive to limit overall expenditures in campaigns, thereby reducing the pressure on candidates to raise large campaign war chests for defensive purposes beyond the amount necessary to communicate reasonably with voters; (4) reduce the advantage of incumbents and thus encourage competition for elective office; (5) allow candidates and officeholders to spend a smaller proportion of their time on fundraising and a greater proportion of their time dealing with issues of importance to their constituents' community; (6) ensure that serious candidates are able to raise enough money to communicate their views and positions adequately to the public, thereby promoting public discussion of the important issues involved in political campaigns; (7) limit contributions to candidates and committees, including committees that make independent expenditures, to eliminate or reduce the appearance or reality that large contributors may exert undue influence over elected officials; and (8) help restore public trust in governmental and electoral institutions. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This Chapter is enacted in accordance with the terms of Sections 5 and 7 of Article XI of the Constitution of the State of California and Section \n1.101 of the Charter of the City and County of San Francisco. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SEC. 1.102.
