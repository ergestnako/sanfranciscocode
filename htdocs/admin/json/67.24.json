In the case of negotiations for a contract, lease or other business agreement in which an agency of the City is offering to provide facilities or services in direct competition with other public or private entities that are not required by law to make their competing proposals public or do not in fact make their proposals public, the policy body may postpone public access to the final draft agreement until it is presented to it for approval. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Litigation Material.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Notwithstanding any exemptions otherwise provided by law, the following are public records subject to disclosure under this Ordinance: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A pre-litigation claim against the City;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A record previously received or created by a department in the ordinary course of business that was not attorney\/client privileged when it was previously received or created; \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(iii)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Advice on compliance with, analysis of, an opinion concerning liability under, or any communication otherwise concerning the California Public Records Act, the Ralph M.

Records pertaining to any investigation, arrest or other law enforcement activity shall be disclosed to the public once the District Attorney or court determines that a prosecution will not be sought against the subject involved, or once the statute of limitations for filing charges has expired, whichever occurs first. Notwithstanding the occurrence of any such event, individual items of information in the following categories may be segregated and withheld if, on the particular facts, the public interest in nondisclosure clearly and substantially outweighs the public interest in disclosure: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The names of juvenile witnesses (whose identities may nevertheless be indicated by substituting a number or alphabetical letter for each individual interviewed); \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Personal or otherwise private information related to or unrelated to the investigation if disclosure would constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy; \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The identity of a confidential source;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Secret investigative techniques or procedures;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(5)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Information whose disclosure would endanger law enforcement personnel; or\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(6)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Information whose disclosure would endanger the successful completion of an investigation where the prospect of enforcement proceedings is concrete and definite. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This Subdivision shall not exempt from disclosure any portion of any record of a concluded inspection or enforcement action by an officer or department responsible for regulatory protection of the public health, safety, or welfare. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Contracts, Bids and Proposals.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Contracts, contractors' bids, responses to requests for proposals and all other records of communications between the department and persons or firms seeking contracts shall be open to inspection immediately after a contract has been awarded.

The authority to withhold this information applies only to contracts pursuant to which the City (through the Department of Public Health) either pays for health care services or receives compensation for providing such services, including mental health and substance abuse services, to covered beneficiaries through a pre-arranged rate of payment. This provision also applies to rates for managed health care contracts for the University of California, San Francisco, if the contract involves beneficiaries who receive services provided jointly by the City and University.
