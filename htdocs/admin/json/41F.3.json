Notwithstanding Conversion approval under this Chapter, a Conversion project must in addition obtain all applicable City permits and approvals, including any applicable conditional use authorization requirements. This Chapter shall not limit City discretion to deny or approve with conditions a proposed Conversion project. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Conversion prior to November 1, 2010. Notwithstanding the foregoing restriction, the Planning Commission may approve use of Conversion credits for a total of up to 550 Large Tourist Hotel Rooms to be Converted prior to November 1, 2010. The Planning Commission shall approve applications for Conversions under this section on a first-come first-served basis. An applicant's place in the Conversion queue for the 550 pre-lottery Conversion credits shall be based upon the date the Planning Department receives a complete subdivision or environmental application, as determined by the Zoning Administrator, and provided the application or subsequent written communication identifies the number of tourist hotel rooms to be Converted. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ancillary Hotel Areas.

Beginning in 2010, the Planning Department shall hold an annual lottery for Conversion credits for Large Tourist Hotel Rooms in accordance with the following: \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Planning Department shall hold the lottery only if:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(i)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Annual Inventory shows a net increase of at least 100 Large Tourist Hotel Rooms over the prior year's inventory, as calculated in Section \n41F.3(g) below; and \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(ii)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Conducting a lottery would not result in a reduction in the number of Large Tourist Hotel Rooms below the Baseline Inventory.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The number of Conversion credits available in each lottery shall equal the net increase in Large Tourist Hotel Rooms during the previous year's inventory. Large Tourist Hotel Rooms lost through authorized Conversions shall not be considered for purposes of calculating the net increase in Large Tourist Hotel Rooms under this section, as described in Section \n41F.3(g), below. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(3)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In order to participate in the conversion credit lottery, applicants must submit a Section \n41F.3(f)(3) application within 15 business days of the formal adoption of the Annual Inventory update.

Winning lottery tickets shall be chosen randomly, one at a time. If not enough credits remain in the pool to satisfy a winning ticket, then the applicant shall receive the number of credits remaining in the pool and be eligible to receive the remainder as the first applicant on the standby list. If a lottery would otherwise be required by the Chapter and the number of available credits exceeds the total number of applicants' requests for Conversion credits in a particular year, then the credits shall be granted and no lottery shall take place. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(5)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If applicants collectively seek more Conversion credits than are available in the lottery pool, then, after the last winning ticket is drawn, the Planning Department shall draw a reasonable number of alternate tickets for inclusion in a standby list.

An award of Conversion credits does not grant the credit-holder a right to development or otherwise limit City discretion to deny or approve with conditions a proposed Conversion project. A credit holder must still obtain all otherwise applicable City permits and approvals, including but not limited to Planning Commission approval of the Conversion pursuant to Section \n41F.3(f). \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(2)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Credits are building-specific and non-transferable, except that if the credit holder does not make diligent and good faith efforts within nine months of issuance of the Conversion credit(s), the credits may be revoked and reallocated to the queue, for pre-lottery credits, or the standby list, for lottery credits. Credits shall expire if the applicant or standby-list recipient fails to diligently and in good faith pursue Conversion for any 18 consecutive months, as determined by the Zoning Administrator after notice and a public hearing.
