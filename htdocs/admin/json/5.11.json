No. 8308 (1939), Sec. 7)\n\nARTICLE IV:\nPEDESTRIAN SAFETY ADVISORY COMMITTEE\n\n\nSec. 5.20.\nFindings; Establishment and Organization. \n\nSec. 5.21.\nDuties of the Committee. \n\nSEC. 5.20.\u00a0 FINDINGS; ESTABLISHMENT AND ORGANIZATION.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Board of Supervisors finds and declares that it is in the public interest to officially recognize walking as an important component of our transportation system, and as a key component to creating livable and suitable communities. Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors seeks to develop and implement focused policies that encourage pedestrian safety, education, and convenience in transportation and city planning. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the past fifty years, many American cities, including San Francisco, have seen a dramatic shift away from pedestrian and public transportation toward a reliance on the private automobile for primary transportation. In that same time period, the City has seen a reduction of its public walkways, pedestrian rights-of-way, and valuable inner-city green spaces. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In San Francisco, as throughout the world, the quality of urban life is being threatened by encroaching environmental actors. San Franciscans also suffer from increasing poor air quality, elevated noise levels, increased traffic congestion, longer trip times, and diminishing public space. These and other factors have led San Francisco to adopt a Transit-First policy favoring public transportation, bicycles, and pedestrian travel over the use of automobiles. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The City's streetscape is similar to many cities and towns in Europe. Narrow streets and interesting destinations combine to make our streets conducive to walking. Encouraging pedestrian presence on our City's streets and sidewalks not only reduces our City's reliance on the automobile, but also helps create communities and neighborhoods that are deemed livable and desirable. Better pedestrian planning and policies will not only serve the approximately 10% of San Franciscans who walk to work on a regular basis, but also all visitors to and residents of San Francisco because each person is a pedestrian at some point in every trip they take. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0San Francisco has an unusually high rate of pedestrian injuries for a city its size. In the past five years, nearly 5,000 pedestrians have been injured on city streets, and over 130 people have been killed. Our seniors, youth, and citizens with disabilities are especially at risk for being injured and\/or killed in a motor vehicle collision. Nationally, pedestrians account for only 13% of traffic fatalities and 2.2% of traffic injuries. However, in San Francisco, they account for more than half of the motor-vehicle related deaths and about one-third of the hospitalizations and have outnumbered or equaled car occupants in traffic fatalities in San Francisco in nine of the past ten years. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There shall be established a Pedestrian Safety Advisory Committee. This Advisory Committee, composed of concerned and informed residents, will provide a source of expertise on issues concerning pedestrian safety, convenience, ambiance, and planning. The Advisory Committee shall consist of 23 voting members appointed as set forth below. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(1)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Board of Supervisors shall appoint 21 members from the following categories:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two representatives from pedestrian safety organizations;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two representatives from senior or disability organizations;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One representatives from bicycle or other non-motorized wheeled personal transport organizations;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One representatives from transit or environmental organizations;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One representatives from child advocate or school support organizations;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(f)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One representatives from a public health organization;\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(g)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Two at-large representatives.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(h)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eleven persons appointed by individual members of the Board of Supervisors.

The regional water collection and transmission system, stretching from the Tuolumne River headwaters at Hetch Hetchy to the San Francisco County Line, supplies water to the City as well as to 1.7 million residents and businesses in Alameda, Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties. This system is in need of substantial repair and\/or replacement. In the event of system failure, the City and its suburban customers could be without water for up to 30 days, with portions of the service area going without water for as long as 60 days. The water distribution and wastewater treatment systems within the City are in a similar state of deterioration, threatening the health and welfare of City residents, visitors and the business community. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the past 25 years, funds for upgrading the water collection and power generation facilities of Hetch Hetchy have been in short supply. During this same period, the waste water treatment plants have aged to the point where significant capital improvements are necessary in order for the City to remain in compliance with applicable federal and state water quality regulations. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(c)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (\"PUC\") has never prepared an integrated and coordinated long-term strategic plan consisting of a capital improvement program, a long-range financial plan, an assessment of future utility needs and the evaluation of alternative technologies, private-public partnerships and non-rate payer revenue enhancements. Focusing on short-term planning, the PUC has turned out a series of bond issues, such as Propositions A and B in 1997, which have been promoted to the voters on the basis of broad project generalities. Even within the PUC itself, the list of projects earmarked for specific bond revenues are in a constant state of flux. Projects are frequently delayed and often uncompleted years after funding was approved by the voters. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(d)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Over the past 20 years, the PUC has readily consented to the transfer of \"surplus\" Hetch Hetchy revenues to the City's general fund. Conservatively, these transfers have cost the PUC more than $500 million. During this same period of time, the utility infrastructure deteriorated and rates escalated dramatically. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(e)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The PUC estimates that over the next 20 years, the cost of needed capital improvement projects will amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Although the PUC's capital improvement list undoubtedly contains individual projects that should go forward as soon as practicable, the design, bidding and contract drafting process often takes years to complete. In the absence of long-term strategic planning, individual projects have been frequently delayed and, in some cases, actually abandoned as funding and project priorities unaccountably shifted over time. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(f)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The health and welfare of all of the PUC's customers would be promoted by the creation of a qualified body committed to a persistent, vigorous and independent review of the expenditure of revenue bond funds for the PUC's capital improvement program over the next decade. An on-going review of this kind would be of material assistance to both the PUC and the Board of Supervisors (\"Board\") in ensuring that the program is carried out in compliance with all applicable laws. \n(Added by Proposition P, 11\/5\/2002)\n\nSEC. 5A.31.\u00a0 ESTABLISHMENT AND PURPOSE.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(a)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There is hereby established a Public Utilities Revenue Bond Oversight Committee (the \"Committee\"), which shall have the responsibility of reporting publicly to the Mayor, the PUC and the Board of Supervisors (\"Board\") regarding the PUC's (or, to the extent allowed by law, any charter entity succeeding to the PUC's authority related to expenditure of revenue bonds) expenditure of revenue bond proceeds on the repair, replacement, upgrading and expansion of the City's water collection, power generation, water distribution and wastewater treatment facilities. \n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(b)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Committee shall provide oversight to ensure that: (1) The proceeds from revenue bonds authorized by the Board and\/or the voters of the City are expended in accordance with the authorizing bond resolution and applicable law; (2) Bond proceeds are expended solely for uses, purposes and projects authorized in the bond resolution; and (3) Revenue bond funds are appropriately expended for authorized capital improvements so that an uninterrupted supply of water and power continues to flow to the City and to the PUC's customers.
